# Scratch_Implementations
In this repository,there are the Implementations of the Multi-Class Naive Bayesian Classifier, Logistic Regressor , Dense Neural Networks/MLPs, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Linear Regressor from scratch.

For Classification purposes we use the K-MNIST Dataset and For the Regression Purposes we use the California Housing Dataset.
